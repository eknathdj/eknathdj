## 🎯 What Drives Me

I believe in **Infrastructure as Code**, **GitOps**, and **automation-first** approaches to DevOps. My goal is to eliminate toil, reduce deployment friction, and create self-healing systems that allow developers to focus on building great products.

### Current Focus Areas:
- 🔹 Cloud-native application deployment patterns
- 🔹 Kubernetes cluster automation and optimization
- 🔹 GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- 🔹 Terraform module development and best practices
- 🔹 CI/CD pipeline optimization and security
- 🔹 Azure infrastructure architecture and cost optimization
- 🔹 Monitoring, observability, and SRE practices

## 💡 DevOps Philosophy

> "Automate everything, monitor continuously, improve iteratively, and never stop learning."

I'm a strong advocate for:
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Treating infrastructure with the same rigor as application code
- **GitOps** - Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications
- **Immutable Infrastructure** - Replacing rather than modifying deployed infrastructure
- **Continuous Everything** - Integration, Delivery, Deployment, and Improvement
- **Security by Design** - Integrating security practices throughout the DevOps lifecycle
